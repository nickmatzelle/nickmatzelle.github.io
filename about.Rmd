## Summary

I am a senior at SUNY GENESEO pursuing an Accounting major with minors in Finance and Data Analytics. Over the course of my 4 years in school, I have found a strong passion in out-of-class learning within the Student Managed Investment Fund (SMIF). The SMIF is a club ran by about 60 student, where individual groups make pitches on different company stock.
