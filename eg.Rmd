## Project Overview

DATASET: https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/
The data we will be using for this project is the college scorecard dataset, derived from the U.S. department of Education 

Within this data set, are institution-level data files ranging from the years 1996 to 2020, containing the aggregated data from institutions across the country (Enrollment, student aid, costs, and student outcome).

Our plan is to evaluate trends for post-graduate debt relative to the studentsâ€™ chosen majors over the course of about 20 years.
